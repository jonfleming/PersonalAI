 * Notes Updated from 3/3
   
   * Surgical case yesterday. Lap coli. I was sooo (struggling)…I don’t do surgical…It was so awesome to see the operative status
     criteria! So easy to use!
     The Unit C3s love the tool. Everyone is using it now.
     IAD Really helps, the users don’t find it cumbersome or confusing. They find it really easy to use.
     It’s going to be awesome. This tool is great. I read something that it decreases the timing of a review from 15-20 minutes.
     This is really valuable and I see it as a big time savings.Continued stay for observation is going excellent.Love the
     discharge milestones for the discharge criteria. They find it very helpful when doing snap huddles. It helps generate
     questions – “Why are they staying here…?” etc.
     
     * Its really helpful for the progression of care as well. Helps move the patient along.
     
     Sarah talked about IEF today and will be reaching out about that too
