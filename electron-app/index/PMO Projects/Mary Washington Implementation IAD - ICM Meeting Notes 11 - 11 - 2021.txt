Agenda/Notes

Issues Updates

 * Roll Out Plan
   
   * Mary confirmed there are no more error messages.
   
   * 5 Users using IAD - no error messages seen.
   
   * MCG will kick off development work for not allowing parent indications to be selected unless the child indications are
     selected and accurate. ETA for this is early 2022.
     
     * Mary will check in w/Kim (Manager of UM nurses) on roll out plan in phases.
     
     * Mary to confirm with Kim number of expected users.

 * Mary will share templates used in workflow that is dropped in the notes section by 11/12.

 * Duplicate Criteria Review Record (in Epic) discussion
   
   * Mary will repro duplicate criteria review case in TST and will send screenshot to MCG.

 * MCG will continue to work on implementing MW’s feedback to roadmap.

Backlog

 * Summary notes configuration
   
   * Epic reported they add timestamps on the Epic UI (even if MCG does not send timestamps as part of our summary).
   
   * This is an Epic feature enhancement request that will require development work on their end.
   
   * The recommendation from MCG is to follow up with your Epic TS for updates and to continue to let them know you would like
     this enhancement.
   
   * Natalie will continue to follow up with Jacob from Epic however we do not have a timeline for this work.

SUCCESS CRITERIA

Challenges

Outcomes

Requirements

 * LOINC Code Alignment
   
   * During Kickoff call, we need to determine where the client is with LOINC code implementations. These codes are used by the
     Synapse reasoning engine and should be updated for successful matching in IAD

 * LOINC Codes are up to date in the client’s EPIC system

 * Describe what's needed to achieve those results

 * Note Type Configuration

 * Determine where Mary Washington [https://mcg.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Account/00130000000ROgmAAG/view] would like the
   output saved. Epic Progress Note field and ICM or only to ICM.

Have Notes in Case Management in Epic (similar to Stormont Vail).
