Backlog

 * Summary notes configuration
   
   * Epic reported they add timestamps on the Epic UI (even if MCG does not send timestamps as part of our summary).
   
   * This is an Epic feature enhancement request that will require development work on their end.
   
   * The recommendation from MCG is to follow up with your Epic TS for updates and to continue to let them know you would like
     this enhancement.
   
   * Natalie will continue to follow up with Jacob from Epic however we do not have a timeline for this work.
