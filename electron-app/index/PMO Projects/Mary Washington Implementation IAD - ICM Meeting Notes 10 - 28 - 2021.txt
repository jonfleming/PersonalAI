   * Completed the review.
   
   * Received error message in ICM.
   
   * Clicked “New Indicia” → “Edit Current Episode”.
   
   * Engineers have identified a fix that will be available soon - will f/u with team on ETA.

 * The information entered into IAD seemed to flow over twice.
   
   * MCG is investigating this issue.
   
   * In the interim Indicia admin can configure settings to delete dupes.

 * Timeout message box on IAD
   
   * MCG increased Mary Washington’s timeout to 60 mins.

 * IAD/ICM integration issues update
   
   * MCG has added additional logging to catch when errors are occurring.
     
     * MCG received hf 13.6.2 in TEST.
     
     * Will schedule upgrade in PRD once TEST completed.
   
   * Mary Washington will work on logging patients for the rest of the week and send daily reports to Abbey.
     
     * 27 cases logged. 25/27 saved successfully. 2 unsuccessful (notes didn’t save from IAD to ICM when IAD was opened for an
       extended time trying to determine status) cases (11:00 AM and 12:50PM ET).
     
     * No unsuccessful cases today.
     
     * Mary will submit reporting log tomorrow.
     
     * Currently, users are using a word workflow to document notes.

 * Delayed medication data
   
   * Limit to between start and end of the encounter.
   
   * MCG is working on a fix for this. to f/u with ETA.

 * MCG will continue to work on implementing MW’s feedback to roadmap.

Backlog

 * Summary notes configuration
   
   * Epic reported they add timestamps on the Epic UI (even if MCG does not send timestamps as part of our summary).
   
   * This is an Epic feature enhancement request that will require development work on their end.
   
   * The recommendation from MCG is to follow up with your Epic TS for updates and to continue to let them know you would like
     this enhancement.
   
   * Natalie will continue to follow up with Jacob from Epic however we do not have a timeline for this work.

SUCCESS CRITERIA

Challenges

Outcomes

Requirements

 * LOINC Code Alignment
   
   * During Kickoff call, we need to determine where the client is with LOINC code implementations. These codes are used by the
     Synapse reasoning engine and should be updated for successful matching in IAD

 * LOINC Codes are up to date in the client’s EPIC system

 * Describe what's needed to achieve those results

 * Note Type Configuration

 * Determine where Mary Washington [https://mcg.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Account/00130000000ROgmAAG/view] would like the
   output saved. Epic Progress Note field and ICM or only to ICM.

Have Notes in Case Management in Epic (similar to Stormont Vail).
