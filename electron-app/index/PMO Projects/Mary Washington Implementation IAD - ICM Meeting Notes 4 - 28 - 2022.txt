Agenda/Notes

Agenda

 * Tickets: MCG 00303008 and SLG with Epic 6772028.
   
   * MW reporting issues w/launching IAD intermittently.
   
   * 4/20/22, IAD was launching with Internet Explorer, for users configured to use Edge (and IAD did not launch successfully in
     Internet Explorer) (this is with the Nov 2021 release)
   
   * Users were also reporting that they were seeing the full launch URL in the browser window (when launched in a separate
     window), which was not the case previously.
   
   * With the Feb 2022 release (in the test environment), the team is testing an option to 'use default browser', which is briefly
     opening a separate window with a message similar to 'using default browser'; this window closes, and a separate browser
     window opens behind the user's Epic window; MCG had not seen this configuration before, but this behavior did not seem to be
     what the MW users were expecting.
   
   Per Dominic Berra:
   
   * Mary Washington is taking a SU fix tomorrow morning (4/27) that the Epic team expects to resolve all the issues noted above.

 * Mary Washington will install fixes to resolve the two issues (1. full url displaying and 2. launch error) in PROD on 5/10 with
   Epic upgrade per Epic’s request.
   
   * Lori and Mary confirmed issues resolved in TEST.

Action Items

 * will f/u with the team on why the calculator (after CURB score) is not displaying for the gl “PNA: OBS CARE OC-030).

 * Chamnan will update the meeting cadence to monthly.

 * will send Mary an email next week for Kelley and Cathy’s on site visit.

 * will sync to work on values story.
