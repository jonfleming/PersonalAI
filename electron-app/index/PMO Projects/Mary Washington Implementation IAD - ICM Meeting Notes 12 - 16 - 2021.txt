Backlog

 * Summary notes configuration
   
   * Epic reported they add timestamps on the Epic UI (even if MCG does not send timestamps as part of our summary).
   
   * This is an Epic feature enhancement request that will require development work on their end.
   
   * The recommendation from MCG is to follow up with your Epic TS for updates and to continue to let them know you would like
     this enhancement.
   
   * Natalie will continue to follow up with Jacob from Epic however we do not have a timeline for this work.

Observations Reported

Resolution

Status

 * Duplicate CRRs/reviews” observed in Epic CCM-
   
   * Example: User A entered first review in ICM; User B updates review and enters 2nd note on the same patient in ICM. When User
     B saves their review in ICM and exits, User A’s review was duplicated, with User B as the reviewer a duplicate review is
     created.

 * Users are selecting “create new episode” instead of “update episode” after IAD CRR has been created in Epic.

 * Users should select “create new episode” when IAD review has been completed, but once Clinical Indications for Admission CRR is
   created in UR tab → select “update episode”

 * This workflow update will be included in a training w/Sandy.
