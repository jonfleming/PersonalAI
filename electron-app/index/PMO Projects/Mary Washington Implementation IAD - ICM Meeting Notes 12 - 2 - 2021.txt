Agenda/Notes

Development Enhancement and Resolution Updates

 * Duplicate CRRs/reviews” observed in Epic CCM-
   
   1. Example: User A entered first review in ICM; User B updates review and enters 2nd note on the same patient in ICM. When User
      B saves their review in ICM and exits, User A’s review was duplicated, with User B as the reviewer a duplicate review is
      created.
      
      1. Users are selecting “create new episode” instead of “update episode” after IAD CRR has been created in Epic.
      
      2. Users should select “create new episode” when IAD review has been completed, but once Clinical Indications for Admission
         CRR is created in UR tab → select “update episode”
   
   2. so will sync with Sandy Z. on having users use the ‘edit episode’ vs. ‘create new episode’ icon to update the admission
      encounter in the next refresher training.
   
   3. Mary will sync w/Kim on refresher dates for edits before the holidays

 * Screenshot from Mary "met" in Indicia and "not met" in Epic item
   
   * Mary and team will continue to monitor and send MCG examples when/if this occurs.

 * UR tab is displaying both Notes and Preview notes creating duplicate data.

 * MCG completed the development work for the manual and automatic indications met enhancement.
   
   * Change will occur in IAD ONLY and not ICM. - No upgrades needed.
   
   * ETA for C3 refresher session (to include edit training; IAD + enhancements) beginning of ?January 2022.
   
   * Chamnan will sync w/Sandy on training requests.

Backlog

 * Summary notes configuration
   
   * Epic reported they add timestamps on the Epic UI (even if MCG does not send timestamps as part of our summary).
   
   * This is an Epic feature enhancement request that will require development work on their end.
   
   * The recommendation from MCG is to follow up with your Epic TS for updates and to continue to let them know you would like
     this enhancement.
   
   * Natalie will continue to follow up with Jacob from Epic however we do not have a timeline for this work.
