PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:

SoF customers are running into issues when their configuration is wrong. Example scenarios are mary Washington documenting in the
ICM test site instead of prod. When the issue comes to TSS and SEAD engineers spend time assuming this is software issue. So
effort is not well spent. How can we avoid that.

Other customers experienced this problem: Maine Health, Mary Washington.


TIMELINE:

Date Time

Event

Gap Identified/ Change proposed



Mary Wa went live with ICM SoF. Tenant Id and Fhir Id are not updated.

Epic implementation guide has gaps. Tenant Id and Fhir Id are not mentioned to be updated.



Can we get a snapshot the FDI configuration?

Secrets might be shared in the snapshot.





Client email stating the problem that they are not able to see the reviews from ICM to Epic.





Implementation replied on configuration settings. We were not able to find the issue here because the customer overlooked the
details.





TSS got notified. Interface logs are missing the information for documentation requests in PROD.





ICM Team got notified. Able to identify root cause.

Having no logs should indicate that there is a wrong configuration.



Product and Implementation confirmed with customer that tenant Id is wrong




DECISIONS:

1 complete Raise Epic ticket to update ICM Tenant Id and Fhir Id on Epic side. 2 complete Encourage the client to add the FDI
configuration to the TSS ticket and Implementation guide. Mark 3/22/23 - adding this to the implementation guides falls to the
Product/Writers teams. I worked with our teams to add check items for FDI elements to the SOF upgrade agendas and TaskRay project
tasks lists. 3 incomplete Explore a way to eliminate the prod data coming into test data based on source and environment. Long
term. Create the Jira ticket to track.
