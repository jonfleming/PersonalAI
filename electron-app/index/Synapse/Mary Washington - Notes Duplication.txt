Questions:

 1. what is the expected behavior here? When you say send "Note" vs. "Preview Note.", what is the expected behavior?

 2. Do ICM want data included in the blue rectangle (indications as selected in ICM), or do ICM only want the note IAD sent to ICM
    (saved as a clinical note)

Note Duplication meeting attended by

2 options

 1. Indicia accepts the notes section
    
    1. Ideal solution - work to be done by Indicia
    
    2. Require the hotfix
    
    3. Remove PreviewNote from everywhere in the payload - Synapse work
       
       1. Note contains only calculator and additional notes

 2. IAD to send the user entered indication note (free text) as part of 'ClinicalSourceInput' - work to be done by Synapse
    
    1. Remove PreviewNote from everywhere in the payload
       
       1. Note contains only calculator and additional notes
    
    2. Update section/'ClinicalSourceInput' and outline/'ClinicalSourceInput'
       
       1. User entered indication note doesn't have a date => clarify this with indicia team

Next Steps: Meet on Monday to decide on the priority and which option to choose . to schedule a meeting.



Notes from meeting



 * Discussed the above options and considered a third option for IAD to only send free text to ICM, which is not an ideal
   solution, as user will miss the indication level free text.

 * Agreed that Option 1 is ideal, however Indicia team is currently focusing on GA work.

 * Option2 can be done as a short term fix and prioritize Option1.
