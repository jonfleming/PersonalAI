What would you like to change?

Appreciated Abbey/Chamnan''s cadence of weekly meetings. Appreciated the opportunity to meet, clarify, and check in. I don't know
if this is always how you do it, but I appreciated it.

Stakeholders missing from some important timeline and development conversations.

Mary doing the training. Really wouldâ€™ve preferred for Sandy to lead. Why was that set up the way it was?

 * Sandy got the impression she (Mary) wanted to do it. Couldn't talk her out of it. For the most part of it, she did a good job
   and still missed some best practice. They were missing some best practice around general guidelines.
   
   * Would like to have notes updated to document why Mary did training. Sandy, do you have any notes or emails you can share?
   
   * Was a back up trainer offered?

 * I know MCG, and at times, I found the training to be too fast and not accurate





Mary was a good training to people that may have been through content training many times over. It would be interesting to find
out how they are doing post-training. Cathy will be doing an onsite soon to help see how things are going.





Client is still not using the Episode Summary. When I first took the account Patty Lipson (who has been in UR) told me that they
don't send the episode summary because it looks awful and the payers don't like it. Kelley offered to adjust and help them. Even
did an on-site. Mary even said she doesn't know why they aren't sending it.

 * Goal is to get Episode Summary sent to the payer.
   
   * All the work for nothing. No outcomes.





Debrief on the temperature and relationships at the client site prior to kick off





AEs are still unclear on data collection. Need clarification on CDA. Is it included? Is it not? How do we show them their data.





Include key stakeholders on all meeting minutes
