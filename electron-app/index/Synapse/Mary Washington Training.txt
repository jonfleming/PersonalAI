Introduction by Mary:

 * MCG is a team of experts. They’re a proven team that works with payers and providers and is now working with us to make sure
   we’re doing things the best way. IAD is a really cool tool with lots of features and will minimize the time spent in reviews.
   All the criteria drops in and helps with efficiency with initial reviews.

 * Current state: Confusion among the teams. Seasoned case managers vs new case managers. Back in 2019, MCG brought best practice
   to the table. The previous PA deviated from the best practice and we saw a whole progression of notes and clinical information
   that sometimes doesn't support MCG criteria. Some of the notes sent to payers doesn't tell the real story. If we’re not using
   the best process to document, we don't have the best processes in place for reimbursement.

 * We’ve done so much work with the IAD tool and have refined the processes so the tool is working well.

Demo of IAD by Mary:

 * The only thing that IAD does not have is the RRG guidelines. Therefore, we will always start by looking at inpatient.

 * Demoed selecting indications for Pneumonia M-282
   
   * Added clinical notes
   
   * Added free text “additional” notes

 * If you decide to go back and select a different guideline your notes disappear. Once you start your documentation, you don't
   want to change guidelines. Do all your searching up front.
   
   * Idea to add an “are you sure” button if users try to select a new guideline after documenting indications.

 * Look how beautiful it is (referring to the indication level notes and how it aligns with the indications/criteria)

 * Look how awesome that it is.. That is very helpful (referring to calculator)

Demo of continued stay and discharge criteria

Demo of IAD for Myocardial Infarc in-patient admission

 * Documentation completed quickly <5 min

 * Showcased how IAD highlights (problem list highlight) and indication was selected.

 * Looked through labs for troponin levels
   
   * Did not use the search box, but should have
   
   * Mentioned that she typically looks through EPIC for labs because it’s easier to read there
   
   * Had to add troponin values manually in indication notes

 * User initially looked in EPIC for notes, and saw that the progress note was also in IAD. But may still be easier to read in
   EPIC

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



 * Mary showing IAD workflow and trained users that if they add notes, they will lose all their data if they click to a new
   guideline:
   
   * “That’s HORRIBLE” was one reaction.
   
   * Similar to above - suggest addition of a button to warn users before data is erased on GL change.

 * Mary unable to edit age in Calculator - age was preloaded.:

 * 

 * I’ll tell you, after using this (ICM) for a year and a half, and now using IAD, when you go back to IAD and it just pulls the
   labs over, I still find myself still going over to the lab section because of how its organized and how my brain works.

 * Now that the data is flowing to IAD, It will highlight and pull that information over under the tachypnea and flow into your
   note.

 * This is an electronic tool, you guys are the brains, you still have to go in and validate.

 * Cardiac patient review:
   
   * Direct admit
   
   * Acute HF Review
     
     * If we think about this, we want to know why the patient is here.
     
     * Read Physician notes
       
       * If we look down at our impression it is acute on chronic congestive HF.
       
       * Swelling
       
       * Tightness
       
       * Right lower
       
       * Tachycardia
       
       * Rhythm is irregular
       
       * Denies any known history of CHF
       
       * Clinically he’s presenting with CHF
     
     * Navigated to the Lab tab in Epic
       
       * Took look at creatine and GFR
       
       * What do you think of the new Epic view??
         
         * I DONT LIKE IT
         
         * Labs show everything in the last 21 days - “Lab 21 Day” is the name of the view.
   
   * Created UR note
     
     * UR Tab
     
     * New
     
     * Create Note
     
     * 

Ste time of review

 * Launched IAD

 * Pulled in Dx
   
   * Reviewed Inpatient
   
   * Left IAD to go back and look at vitals in epic to see the trends
     
     * 
   
   * Went to Cardiology tab to review notes/ekg impressions
   
   * Documented “First episode with no prior history of heart failure:
   
   * Opened physician notes in IAD and copied/pasted data to the indication note
     
     * Issues when trying to edit the note after typing text.
     
     * Mary could not edit, delete, copy, paste etc.
     
     * Asked Mary to report if this is still happening when they are back at their workstations. This seems connected to the fact
       that they are all in one room working on a connection from the basement of the hospital.
   
   * Copied and pasted cardiology notes - Impressions
   
   * Could not search for or filter lab results

 * Click “Save in IAD”

 * Come over, click on Utilization review tab → New → Indicia → Exit → and it flows right over.

 * After you done that and the box is there, do you have to go to IAD and exit? or do you leave it alone?

Test patient:

 * Added note

 * IAD

 * I50.9 search

 * Heart failure

 * Clicked indication to add note: Per cardiology note: no prior history of CHF

 * Additional notes

 * Save

 * UR

 * New Indicia

 * Exit - using the red x

Sometimes on the floor you get interrupted, can you go back in?

 * Mary discussed pressing save so the data flows to ICM and using ICM for all additional documentation/edits

That is IAD. What do you think?

 * For IAD, there has to be a diagnosis? You cant use general?

 * Mary showed a general case via edit episode in ICM

 * Then launched to IAD to demo

 * Couldn't find General Inpatient guideline. Expected the ability to see General Admission Criteria.

Regarding C3s (new role at MW) not necessarily MCG specific:

 * There was resistance, and nobody likes change. In the fall, Covid was ramping up. But now, things are calming down, we're
   getting into the spring, I think people will be more receptive. After we tweak the C3s to be more specific and explain to them
   why we need them to do this work, the time has come where they will be more receptive.

 * You're asking a bedside nurse to open 3 programs, answer the phone, care for a patient. it’s a lot.

Discussing getting to met:

 * If you can get the boxes to check and they’re green, click them and move one. I dont care if its a soft meet or hard meet. If
   you can get it to turn green and support what you click, if there's one thing, that’s enough!

Patient meets obs (workflow) not MCG specific.

 * You know how we used to document obs 2 a day? Stop that. You are going to look at your obs case, and by nature of SNAP, you are
   doing an obs review. If its a teetering patient, hold off on your acutal re-view until 2pm until you have results back. AND,
   its still early enough to make your referral to the team as needed if they convert.

 * We want standardization. that is the goal of this meeting! To get standardization. We are eating bite size pieces.





 * Heart Failure M-190
   
   * Use the data on the right hand side so you don’t need to go back to Epic to look at this info
   
   * What MCG labs and vitals don’t show that EPIC has:
     
     * Abnormal values highlighted in red
     
     * Baseline information is available
     
     * Trending information (as a snapshot it is probably visually informative & easy to understand)
     
     * Example data of creatinine progressive
   
   * While Mary was demonstrating how to select parents in indication tree (and explaining that they need to do this step)
     
     * Comment from trainee: Why doesn’t it automatically select parents, in theory it should?
     
     * Mary - they are working on it
   
   * Were you all here when MCG crashed and burned yesterday?
     
     * Outage for all of their clients, 1.5 hours

 * C3 practice - first time review - LIVE prod patient
   
   * First thing was to review clinical notes in IAD
   
   * Labs: CMP (Comprehensive Metabolic Panel)
     
     * Can’t see historical so looking at Labs in Epic
   
   * Hypertension M-197 changed to Renal Failure, Acute (no calculator)
     
     * It matched on second node (double check this because I saw pediatric in text of indication)
       
       * It looked like there was a match on the second node, I don’t think this should have happened because it’s for peds?
     
     * Looked for more clinical notes in Epic
     
     * Spent several minutes calculating eGFR
     
     * Added 2-fold rise data manually on ‘2-fold or more rise in serum creatinine from baseline’
       
       * Cr 2.8 improved to 2.7 baseline 1.0 rise since 2017 (was this the correct place for this note?)
     
     * Happy with blood pressure values and highlighting automatically
       
       * “See, those suggestions in IAD are super helpful” Mary
   
   * Put entire Diagnostic into Additional notes (Nephrology consult notes)
     
     * Someone asked if this was too much info, but Mary said it’s fine



----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why are we here today?

 * Lets look at our current state. We have old CMs, new CMs, a mixture and everyone has a different way of doing things.

 * Back in 2019, we partnered with MCG. MCG is an industry leader in guidelines and have developed workflows and innovative tools
   to get information to the payers to have the best outcomes - reimbursement.

 * MCG implemented and before we got off the ground, we had care logistics come in and PAs came in and wanted to see observation
   reviews done 2/day. The way we are doing it is not best practice. How could we possibly look at that today and make sense of
   why we're doing that today (all the notes). If CMS came in and did an audit and we show them all the clinical notes, what is
   that really telling us? When we follow the best practice workflow and we can show observation documentation or failed obs
   criteria - and what if they meet inpatient, care day 1, 2, 3 etc and show a beautiful audit trail.

 * We got blown off track and were still seeing a lot of clinical notes and everyone is doing things their own way. So we need
   standardization.

Initial reviews

 * We are going to start doing these in an innovative tool that’s super cool, call Indicia for Admission Documentation. What's the
   difference between regular indicia? It pulls in dx, it puts blue boxes around criteria to bring your eyes to see the criteria.
   All the clinical data is on the right hand side. All the back and fourth is going to be limited. MCG says that it can take
   reviews down to minutes. If you think about UR nurses doing 30 charts a day, that’s a lot of saved time!

Feedback from frontline staff on Indicia Continued stay:

 * Fantastic. You know the P3s are SO general that there is talk about forming a sub committee to start marrying the P3s with care
   day milestones because they are so specific. Care logistics is progressive driven where MCG is specific to milestones to check
   off and that is where we’re heading

MCG is a fantastic partner. We worked with them closely to build and enhance IAD.



Mary demonstrated documentation examples:



Kimberly joined the discussion:

 * To recap on our goals: Today, we’re going to introduce you to MCG’s IAD - Artificial intelligence tool to starndardize how
   we’re documenting. We’re also going to look at obs documentation and failed discharge criteria.

IAD Demo:

 * It really clues us in on what to look for and what to pay attention to.

 * Mary demoed with a test patient with no clinical data (IAD Clinical fields were empty). She toggled between a patient summary
   (image above) and IAD to manually populate the indication notes. This workflow took 15 minutes. Could reference as a baseline
   for time to document without IAD/Synapse.

 * Mary mentioned that the one thing she does go back to Epic for is the comprehensive vital signs flow sheet and the
   labs/baseline/trend view.

 * Mary discussed how data flows into IAD and is added to the indications - “Its a lot more robust”

 * Demonstrated how toggling between guidelines will remove any free text notes that users entered.
   
   * How does this work in ICM? I would imagine its the same?

 * Let me show you something with the calculators which is awesome
   
   * Pneumonia/PSI demo
   
   * Text boxes seem to be working fine today (last week they were freezing)
   
   * In normal indicia, you have to document the calculators manually, but in IAD, you just hit “add to note” and its all
     documented! it’s all there for you!
     
     * Demoed editing the calculator values and updating the Calc note.

 * See how MELD score isnt there? You have to go to md calc on google to compute the score.
   
   * Synapse - Add Remaining Calculators to IAD UI (does not include codification)

 * Demoed tree climbing and how you need to select appropriate criteria for the parent indications to be selected
   
   * “MCG has done a fabulous job developing this tool to really enhance what we do”

Documented in IAD

 * Created UR note

 * Launched IAD - Manually searched for the Angina GL
   
   * Clicked back to Epic to view note
   
   * Team member asked if she could look at the note in IAD
   
   * Mary navigated back to IAD and reviewed the note
   
   * copied and pasted data
   
   * Ran into the 250 indication note character limit a few times. Transitioned her documentation to the “Additional Notes'
     section





UI/UX Enhancement Ideas:

 * More detailed lab and vitals view
   
   * abnormal values, trends (spark lines) , colors for signifiers

Calculator:

 * Demo - Mary almost clicked Reset (she hovered on it after selecting check boxes)

Angina GL

 * Ignored CTA to click a diagnosis, did a search right away

 * No auto highlights from IAD

 * They expected this to be inpatient prior to launching

 * Now looking for how to get to “Met” (evaluating indications)

 * Found an indication and adding notes

 * Found cardiac cath diagnostic report
   
   * Couldn’t find a findings section
   
   * Huge block of text only - a narrative section
   
   * Added a section from this for the indication

 * Searching Clinical notes to add support for “Crescendo worsening of symptoms (ie, acutely changing)”
   
   * Pasting from notes was too big for indication note
   
   * Deleted and added H&P snippet (indication for procedure) to additional Notes

 * Saved

 * EPIC added/edit UR note

Summary from Mary as a wrap-up

 * Use the right side as much as possible

 * If you select a new GL your notes will be deleted

 * Use the calculator

 * Make sure it says met

 * Children selection selects parents

 * Don't write a book
